abstract: The demand for minerals is rapidly increasing with industrialization, urbanization, and population growth. Sri Lanka has the potential to penetrate the world market with its endowed rich base of minerals despite its small land area. However, selecting a suitable mining method and its optimum utilization have significant roles in the growth of the local mineral mining industry. The lack of systematic approaches in mining methods is suboptimal for the economic growth of Sri Lanka, which demands immediate investigation and reassessment of contemporary mining practices. Thus, this study aims to critique the major mining practices and evaluate their suitability through characteristics and numerical analysis. This investigation was performed for underground mining methods, cut-and-fill stoping and open-stoping; surface mining methods, open-pit, and open-cast placer mining with reference to Bogala, Kahatagaha, Aruwakkalu, and Pulmoddai, respectively. A detailed study complying with the principles of the grounded theory was conducted through a multimethod approach followed by a thematic and content analysis along with the deductive approach. Moreover, the suitability of these methods was evaluated employing the University of British Columbia method through a numerical approach. This study reveals that the selections of mining methods are appropriate for all four mines, and mining practices are modernized and traditional, complying with site-specific requirements.
