abstract: Monitoring surface and near-shore water features is crucial for understanding dynamic environmental behaviours. Advances in satellite-based remote sensing have enabled the cost-effective and sustainable monitoring of water resources. Exploring the subclasses of water features using remote sensing requires further investigation. Spectral signatures have been proven to be effective in distinguishing water resource subclasses. Hence, this study aimed to establish the relationship between spectral signatures and the differentiation of water resource subclasses across wavelength ranges. To assess the effectiveness of the spectral signatures, a methodology combining the maximum difference and categorical matrices was used. This approach aims to compute an indicator matrix for quantitative evaluation. The indicator matrix quantifies the distinguishability between the classes across different wavelength ranges. These results facilitate the selection of optimal band combinations and wavelength ranges to delineate water subclasses efficiently. The findings of this study have practical implications for environmental and scientific applications, especially for classifying water resource subclasses.
