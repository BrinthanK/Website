abstract: "The University of Warwick hosted an extraordinary joint celebration of undergraduate research from April 4th to 6th, 2023. This momentous in-person event marked the first-ever combination of a national conference of undergraduate research and the World Congress, drawing in over 600 delegates to the campus in Coventry, UK. I had the privilege of presenting both my undergraduate research project and the preliminary prospects of my Masters research project during the event. Focusing on the theme of sustainability, my virtual speaking presentation showcased the significance of sustainable practices in research. It was an incredibly rewarding experience as I had the opportunity to share my work with a diverse and international audience, comprising individuals ranging from high school students to esteemed university professors."
