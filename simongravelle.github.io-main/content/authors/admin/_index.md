**About me**
****
I am a <span style="color:blue;">postgraduate student</span> at the *University of Moratuwa*, specialising in the exploration and characterisation of Coal Fly Ash, a waste material. My research covers a broad range of areas, including mineral processing through separation technology, material synthesis and characterisation, machine learning, and digital image processing. My current primary focus is on **computational X-ray microanalysis** and its applications for materials at the nano- and micron-scale.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Additionally, I have a keen interest in applying machine learning and deep learning approaches to address challenges related to monitoring and optimising parameters in earth observation through remote sensing.
